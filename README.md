official system for playing Newedo on foundryvtt

THIS SYSTEM IS IN DEVELOPMENT. SOME FEATURES MAY BE MISSING OR INCOMPLETE
Current version: 0.3.1

## Installation

Before installing this system, you should rename any files that have `newedo` in their filename to use whatever machine-safe name your system needs, such as `adnd2e` if you were building a system for 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. In addition, you should search through the files for `newedo` and `Newedo` and do the same for those, replacing them with appropriate names for your system.
